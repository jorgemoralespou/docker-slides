== Introduction

=== What is Docker?
Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to *build, ship, and run distributed applications*. 
Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub,
 a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be quickly 
assembled from components and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments. 
As a result, IT can ship faster and run the same app, unchanged, on laptops, data center VMs, and any cloud.

=== Why do developers like it?
With Docker, developers can build any app in any language using any toolchain. “Dockerized” apps are completely portable and can run anywhere.

=== Why do sysadmins like it?
Sysadmins use Docker to provide standardized environments for their development, QA, and production teams, 
reducing “works on my machine” finger-pointing. By “Dockerizing” the app platform and its dependencies, 
sysadmins abstract away differences in OS distributions and underlying infrastructure.

== Docker in few words
Docker environments get defined in a test file (Dockerfile) which describes which image it will be using as base (at the minimum a base operating system)
ant then will provision the environment adding capabilities.

image::2.png[]

Once the docker descriptor file is defined, you can build the environment (what is called a docker image) with:

image::3.png[]

[source,bash]
----
docker build -t MYIMAGENAME .
----

image::4.png[]

This will create an environment image (a template of an environment) from which we will be able to create environment instances (docker containers) with:

[source,bash]
----
docker run [OPTIONS] MYIMAGENAME [CMD]
----

We will have an environment/container running and ready to use. We can stop it, start it, delete it, recreate it, and create an image from it.

As building the image is tedious, we can build the image and push it to a docker hub (the central or in our organization).

Once the image is in a hub, any developer can pull it down and just create a container out of it.

== Now the easy way
Scenarios where we might spend some time:

* Developer develops and tests his work in windows while final environment is Linux
* Developer is working on his computer on a project, testing his code and his Mysql database gets corrupted
* Developer needs to work on a clustered functionality, but does it in his own “single” computer
* Developer/Ops needs to create provisioning/deployment/... scripts for final environments, but tests them in his “own” computer while developing
* Continuous Integration Environment runs only JUnit tests as there is no environment to run automated integrated tests for functional, integration,... tests
* Red Hat associate needs to work with a Red Hat product to validate a concept, to create a PoC, a demo, integration between products,....
* Developer finds a bug and opens a support ticket and want to GSSO to reproduce the scenario.

== Docker for Java Developers

* Docker images = Java class
* Docker container = Java instance
* Docker hub = PermGen

http://www.fig.sh/[Fig] orachestrates your containers

Combine multiple containers, link them together and start and stop them at once.

=== Start all of the containers
Build, (re)create, start and attach to containers for a service.

By default, `fig up` will aggregate the output of each container, and
when it exits, all containers will be stopped. If you run `fig up -d`,
it'll start the containers in the background and leave them running.

If there are existing containers for a service, `fig up` will stop
and recreate them (preserving mounted volumes with volumes-from),
so that changes in `fig.yml` are picked up. If you do not want existing
containers to be recreated, `fig up --no-recreate` will re-use existing
containers.

[source,bash]
----
fig up

Usage: up [options] [SERVICE...]

Options:
    -d             Detached mode: Run containers in the background,
                   print new container names.
    --no-deps      Don`t start linked services.
    --no-recreate  If containers already exist, don`t recreate them.
----

=== List containers
[source,bash]
----
fig ps [-q] [SERVICE...] 
----

=== Delete current containers
Remove stopped service containers.


[source,bash]
----
fig rm
Usage: rm [options] [SERVICE...]

Options:
    --force   Don`t ask to confirm removal
    -v        Remove volumes associated with containers

----

=== Log current containers
View output from containers.

[source,bash]
----
fig logs [SERVICE...]
