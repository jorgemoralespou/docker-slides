== Fig
http://www.fig.sh/[Fig] orachestrates your containers

Combine multiple containers, link them together and start and stop them at once.

=== Start all of the containers
Build, (re)create, start and attach to containers for a service.

By default, `fig up` will aggregate the output of each container, and
when it exits, all containers will be stopped. If you run `fig up -d`,
it'll start the containers in the background and leave them running.

If there are existing containers for a service, `fig up` will stop
and recreate them (preserving mounted volumes with volumes-from),
so that changes in `fig.yml` are picked up. If you do not want existing
containers to be recreated, `fig up --no-recreate` will re-use existing
containers.
